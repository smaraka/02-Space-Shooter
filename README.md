# 02-Space-Shooter(Bullet Hell)
Project for MSCH-C220, 25 Semptember 2021

My Project for 02 space arcade shooter. This is inspired by Touhou a japanese bullet hell game that I used to play back in school.

## How to play:
  * Survive by dodging the bullets
  * Kill the boss. Takes about 100 shots
  * Kill any random enemies that spawn to increase score
  * Your bullets can destroy enemy bullets
